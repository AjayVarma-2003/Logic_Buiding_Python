# Problem Statement : Accpet two values from user and perform the addition

# Step 1: Understand problem statement
# conclusion : We have to accept two integers and perform addition

# Step 2: Write algorithm
"""START
    Accept 1st number from user and store it into no1
    Accept 2nd number from user and store it into no2
    Create one variable to store result named as ans
    Perform addition of no1 and no2 and store result into ans
    Display the result from ans to the user
   STOP
"""

# Step 3: Decide the programming language (C / C++ / Java / Python)
# We select python programming 

# Step 4: Write the program

i = input("Enter first value : ")

j = input("Enter second value : ")

result = int(i) + int(j)

print("Sum of given number is : ", result)
